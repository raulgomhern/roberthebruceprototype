Several copies of this cast exist, housed for example at Dunfermline Abbey, the Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow, and the Anatomical Museum of the University of Edinburgh.<br/><br/>After examination, the skeleton was reburied, sealed with pitch, although reports indicate some bone fragments and relics were stolen. Since the original remains remain sealed, subsequent studies have relied exclusively on the skull casts.<br/><br/>
